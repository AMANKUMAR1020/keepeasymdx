# Two Player Card Game Simulation

This problem is a simulation of a two-player card game.

Each player has `n` unique cards numbered `1` to `n`. In every round, both players reveal a card simultaneously.  
- The player with the higher card wins 1 point.  
- If both cards are equal, no one scores.

Given the final scores of both players after all cards have been played, determine whether such a game configuration is possible. If yes, provide an example.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

You're given:

- `t` test cases.  
- For each test case, three integers:  
  - `n`: number of cards per player  
  - `a`: score of player A  
  - `b`: score of player B

Your task is to output:
- `YES` if there exists a valid play sequence producing scores `a` and `b`. Then, provide one possible game by printing the sequence of cards played by both players.
- `NO` otherwise.

## ðŸ”¹ Input Format

- First line: integer `t` â€” number of test cases  
- Next `t` lines: three integers `n a b` per line

---

## ðŸ”¹ Output Format

For each test case:
- Output `YES` and two lines (card sequences for both players) if a valid game exists
- Otherwise, output `NO`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000`  
- `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100`  
- `0 â‰¤ a, b â‰¤ n`

5
4 1 2
2 0 1
3 0 0
2 1 1
4 4 1

**Output:**
YES
1 4 3 2

NO
YES
1 2 3
1 2 3
YES

## ðŸ”¹ Approach

To simulate this:

1. We know that `a + b â‰¤ n` because only one player can win each round.
2. If `a + b > n`, it's an invalid case â†’ `NO`.
3. Otherwise, simulate a valid configuration:
   - Assign `a` rounds where player A plays a higher card than B.
   - Assign `b` rounds where player B wins.
   - Fill remaining with ties.

Use a greedy or constructive approach to generate valid permutations for both players.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Implementation

<CodeBlock>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void solve(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a + b > n) {
        cout << "NO\n";
        return;
    }

    vector<int> A(n), B(n);
    int num_equal = n - a - b;
    int val = 1;

    // Assign ties first
    for (int i = 0; i < num_equal; ++i) {
        A[i] = val;
        B[i] = val;
        ++val;
    }

    // Assign A wins
    for (int i = num_equal; i < num_equal + a; ++i) {
        A[i] = val + 1;
        B[i] = val;
        val += 2;
    }

    // Assign B wins
    for (int i = num_equal + a; i < n; ++i) {
        A[i] = val;
        B[i] = val + 1;
        val += 2;
    }

    // Check for validity
    vector<int> usedA(n + 1, 0), usedB(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (A[i] > n || B[i] > n || A[i] < 1 || B[i] < 1 || usedA[A[i]] || usedB[B[i]]) {
            cout << "NO\n";
            return;
        }
        usedA[A[i]] = 1;
        usedB[B[i]] = 1;
    }

    cout << "YES\n";
    for (int x : A) cout << x << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    for (int x : B) cout << x << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, a, b;
        cin >> n >> a >> b;
        solve(n, a, b);
    }
    return 0;
}
